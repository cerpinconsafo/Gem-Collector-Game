# Greedy Goblin Gem Collector Game
----

This is a simple game, built with javascript and jQuery, and styled with CSS.  The object of the game is for the player to click on the 'gem' buttons so that they loot the exact number of gems that they currently have bagspace for.  If the player loots too many gems, they lose the game, and get sent to the dungeon for a timeout!

## Functionality

The player needs to collect Gems, all of which have a random value, to end up matching the Goblin's Maximum Bagspace 

   * The BAG SPACE number is chosen at random every time a new game begins.

   * When the player clicks on a GEM, it will add a specific amount of gems to the bag. 

       * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

       * The player loses if their score goes above the Goblin's Maxiumum Bagspace.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

   * Each Gem value is unique and resets with each new game
